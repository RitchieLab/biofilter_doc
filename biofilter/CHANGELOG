CHANGELOG

3.0.0

2.4.3 (2023-09-15)
- updated from Python2 to Python3 
- updated LOKI loaders
- fixed a bug in removing redundant results

2.4.2 (2019-03-15)
- fixed a bug in PARIS which may have inflated the reported permutation significance in some cases
- modified PARIS output report formats to reduce redundancy and simplify batch processing
- updated LOKI loaders for dbSNP, MINT and PharmGKB
- removed support for generating LD Profiles during LOKI installation

2.4.1 (2017-04-17)
- fixed a bug in PARIS which included non-gene regions
- updated LOKI loaders for dbSNP, GO and PharmGKB

2.4.0 (2016-05-09)
- implemented the PARIS algorithm with the corresponding --paris output option and other related configuration options
- added limited support for user-defined knowledge (custom gene groups) in --filter and --paris modes
- added --allow-ambiguous-snps option to accept input SNPs with multiple known positions
- fixed a bug in --region-match-bases with a negative value so that it correctly functions like --region-position-margin except for region-region matching
- updated LOKI loaders for gwas and dbsnp

2.3.0 (2015-12-14)
- changed default --report-genome-build option to 'yes'
- added --grch-build-version and --ucsc-build-version options to specify the
  reference gnome build of user input; if it does not match the build used
  in the provided LOKI database, liftOver will be automatically applied
- added --coordinate-base and --regions-half-open options to specify the
  coordinate system conventions of user input and program output
- changed the any-namespace special tag from empty '' to '*'
- fixed a bug in installation on Windows platforms

2.2.0 (2014-06-04)
- fixed a bug when matching gene regions to input regions of size 1
- added support for "extra" input data to be stored with SNPs, positions,
  regions, genes and groups, and corresponding output columns snp_extra, etc.
- (LOKI) added support for parsing updated genome build identities from
  http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQreleases.html
- (LOKI) added warnings for unrecognized genome builds which could lead to
  mismatched data
- (LOKI) added a tally of SNP role records with unrecognized Entrez GeneIDs

2.1.2 (2014-03-31)
- fixed a bug in the 'biopolymer_chr' output column (which is part of
  the 'generegion' output shortcut) which caused a crash with certain
  combinations of input data and requested output
- (LOKI) added support for HTTP (but not SOCKS) proxy servers for downloading
  source data via HTTP

2.1.1 (2013-08-21)
- fixed a bug in model expansion that caused some models to be duplicated in
  reverse order, and some types to be paired with themselves as a model

2.1.0 (2013-07-19)
- REGION_POSITION_MARGIN is now applied when matching positions to
  upstream/downstream gene annotations
- added "gwas_rs" output option
- updated dbsnp loader to handle incomplete SNP roles in dbSNP's data download
- added support for "upstream" and "downstream" gene annotation; the shorthand
  outputs provide the gene label and distance, but "_id", "_start" and "_stop"
  suffixes are also available (i.e. "upstream_start")
- added support for "gwas" catalog ananotation by way of RS# or chr/position,
  with a corresponding LOKI source loader; the shorthand output provides the
  trait, SNPs, OR/beta, allele 95% CI, risk allele frequency and PubMed ID
- removed the file timestamp check in --verify-source-file; file size and hash
  should suffice, and not all sources provide stable timestamps anyway
- fixed a bug in the LOKI updater which would mask the original error if the
  error-handler itself caused an additional error

2.0.0 (2013-02-14)
- first public release
